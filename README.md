# The-Influence-of-Color-on-Moral-Judgments
Conceptual metaphor theory posits that individuals use concrete source domain concepts (such as colors and brightness) to express and comprehend abstract target domain concepts (such as morality). Colors are considered signals containing specific information, and numerous studies suggest a strong compatibility between color and moral valence. This research aims to explore how color influences the perception of moral word judgments.

### Participants:
100 non-psychology major college students with normal color vision.
Experimental Materials: 20 morally neutral and 20 morally charged words (as evaluated in previous research), with significant differences in moral valence and non-significant differences in familiarity. Representative colors were selected, with gray as the background color.

### Experimental Procedure: 
The experimental program was developed and data were recorded using Matlab Psychtoolbox (PTB). A within-subjects design with a 5 (red, green, blue, black, white) Ã— 2 (moral words, immoral words) factorial structure was employed. The dependent variable was the reaction time of participants' correct judgments of words. Each word was presented once with each of the five background colors, resulting in a total of 200 trials presented in a random order, with a 2-minute break between trials. Participants underwent practice rounds before the formal experiment, and only those with an accuracy rate exceeding 80% proceeded to the main experiment. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.
